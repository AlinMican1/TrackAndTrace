# TrackAndTrace

During the pandemic, I developed a COVID-19 Tracker to assist in identifying potential cases and facilitating timely testing. This system utilizes a twenty-four-hour clock and allows users to input a time range when a potentially infected person entered a building. The Tracker then identifies individuals who were in the same time interval and may need a COVID-19 test. If a match is found, the system offers the option to create a file containing the names of those requiring testing.

# How It Works
Time Range Entry: Users input a time range during which a potentially infected person entered a building. The format follows the twenty-four-hour clock system to ensure accurate tracking.

Matching Process: The Tracker matches the entered time range with other individuals who were present in the same interval. This helps identify potential contacts who may need a COVID-19 test.

File Creation: If a match is found, the system prompts the user to create a file to store the names of individuals requiring a COVID-19 test. Users can choose the desired file format and specify the file's location
