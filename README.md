# TrackAndTrace
During the pandemic, I made a tracker for people that may need a test for covid. This was done by using a
twentyfour hour clock, entering a time range when the potential infected person has entered the building. Then we
look at a potential non-infected person that was in that time interval as the infected person was, if this was
the case, then a file would be created by the user's choice to save their name into a file of people that require
a covid test.
